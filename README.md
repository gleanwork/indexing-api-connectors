# indexing-api-connectors

The purpose of these sample connectors is to demonstrate usage of [Glean's Indexing API](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api_getting_started/) to build integrations with datasources. They are not intended to be production-ready connectors.

Each connector is written in its own directory and is self-contained. The README in each directory contains instructions on how to run the connector.
